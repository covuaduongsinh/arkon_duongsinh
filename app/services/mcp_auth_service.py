MCP Auth Service — token verification and scope resolution.

This service is called by the MCP server to:
1. Verify employee MCP token
2. Resolve the employee's department
3. Compute the effective knowledge scope (what docs they can access)
4. Generate and revoke tokens

Permission model v2: uses source_departments M2M and scoped permissions.
